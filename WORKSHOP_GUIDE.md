# Chicken Coop IoT Agent Workshop

## Setup

1. Start Mastra playground: `pnpm run dev`
2. Open browser to playground URL
3. Login to HiveMQ to simulate the IOT device messages

## Available Agents in Playground

### Lab 1: `IoT Monitor Agent`

Basic IoT agent with logging capability. Students will customize the name and instructions.

**Example prompt sequence:**

1. The morning temperature was 65¬∞F at 8 AM
2. What was the temperature this morning? ‚ùå _Agent can't remember_
3. Temperature is now 85¬∞F at 2 PM. How much has it changed? ‚ùå _No historical context_
4. Should we be concerned about the temperature pattern today? ‚ùå _No memory of previous readings_

This shows why Lab 2's memory is essential!

### Lab 2: `Iot Memory Agent`

Agent with persistent memory to track patterns over time.

**Example prompt sequence:**

1. The morning temperature was 65¬∞F at 8 AM
2. What was the temperature this morning? ‚úÖ _Agent can now remember_
3. Temperature is now 85¬∞F at 2 PM. How much has it changed? ‚úÖ _Agent now has historical context_
4. Should we be concerned about the temperature pattern today? ‚úÖ _Can see previous readings_

### Lab 3 & 4: `Chicken Coop Manager`

Full production agent with temperature monitoring, feeding schedules, and memory.

**Lab 3 - Tool Usage Flow:**

1. Check if current temperature is safe ‚Üí Uses `coopTempAlert` tool with real MQTT data
2. When should the chickens be fed next? ‚Üí Uses `feedSchedule` tool
3. Temperature is 98¬∞F, what should we do? ‚Üí Multi-tool response with alerts

**Lab 4 - Human-in-the-Loop Flow:**

1. Schedule feeding in 3 hours ‚Üí Triggers approval request (visible in playground)
2. Agent shows: üîî HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED with action details
3. When user says "yes" to feeding ‚Üí Agent uses `feederControl` tool automatically
4. When user says "no" ‚Üí Agent logs decision and suggests alternatives

## Testing Your Workshop Flow

### Step 1: Connect to MQTT

Connect to MQTT broker using the default connection and then Subscribe to sensors/coop/temp

### Step 2: Send Test Data via HiveMQ Console

```json
// Topic: sensors/coop/temp
{
  "temperature": 72,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Temperature Monitoring

Check if current temperature is safe

- Agent uses real MQTT data (not simulated!)
- Returns safety assessment with recommendations

<!-- ### Step 4: Test Feeding Flow

When should the chickens be fed next?

- Agent calculates feeding schedule
- When you say "yes" ‚Üí Automatically opens feeder via MQTT command
- When you say "no" ‚Üí Logs decision and offers alternatives

### Step 5: Test Human-in-the-Loop

Schedule feeding in 3 hours

- Triggers approval request visible in playground UI
- Shows detailed risk assessment and safety warnings
- Demonstrates human approval workflow -->

### Step 6: Test Multi-Action Response

Temperature is 98¬∞F, what should we do?

- Agent uses multiple tools: temperature alert, environmental controls, logging
- Provides comprehensive response with action plan including:
  - Increase ventilation to cool the coop
  - Provide fresh water for hydration
  - Extend awning for shade
  - Monitor temperature trends

## Additional Test Data Examples

```json
// High temperature alert: sensors/coop/temp
{"temperature": 98, "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z"}

// Low temperature alert: sensors/coop/temp
{"temperature": 32, "timestamp": "2024-01-15T06:00:00Z"}

// Humidity: sensors/coop/humidity
{"humidity": 65, "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:05:00Z"}

// Door status: sensors/coop/door
{"status": "open", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:10:00Z"}
```

## Environmental Control Test Commands

After connecting to MQTT and publishing temperature data, try these:

**High Temperature Scenario (98¬∞F):**

- "The temperature is dangerous, take action immediately"
- Agent will recommend and can execute:
  - Increase ventilation
  - Provide fresh water
  - Extend awning for shade

**Low Temperature Scenario (32¬∞F):**

- "It's freezing, what should we do?"
- Agent will recommend:
  - Reduce ventilation
  - Retract awning
  - Check heating systems

**Manual Controls:**

- "Increase ventilation to 75%"
- "Provide fresh water for the chickens"
- "Extend the awning for shade"

## Querying Historical Data

- "What temperature readings do we have from today?"
- "Show me all sensor data from shared memory"
- "Check shared memory for recent temperature readings"

## Lab Progression

### Lab 1: Build a Simple Agent that Acts

- Students modify `iotAgentBase` name and instructions
- Connect to MQTT and show message ‚Üí agent ‚Üí tool flow
- Use the `logTool` to process sensor readings

### Lab 2: Memory

- Switch to `memoryEnabledAgent`
- Send related prompts to demonstrate recall
- Discuss why memory beats giant prompts

### Lab 3: Tooling

- Switch to `chickenCoopAgent`
- Explore `coopTempAlert` tool (temp safety checks)
- Explore `feedSchedule` tool (feeding management)
- Tools have built-in validation and rate limiting

### Lab 4: Human-in-the-Loop

- Continue with `chickenCoopAgent`
- Trigger approval scenarios by asking for short feeding intervals (< 6 hours)
- Approval requests now display in the playground UI (not just console)
- Shows detailed risk assessments and safety warnings
- Demonstrates human approval workflow for edge cases
